	 * The guards
	 * ----------
	 *
	 * * 'start_guard' is notionally "Kbus", and 'end_guard' (the 32 bit
	 *   word after the rest of the message datastructure) is notionally
	 *   "subK". Obviously that depends on how one looks at the 32-bit
	 *   word. Every message datastructure shall start with a start guard
	 *   and end with an end guard.
	 *
	 * These provide some help in checking that a message is well formed,
	 * and in particular the end guard helps to check for broken length
	 * fields.
	 *
	 * - 'id' identifies this particular message.
	 *
	 *   When a user writes a new message, they should set this to {0,0}.
	 *   KBUS will then set a new message id for the message.
	 *
	 *   When a user reads a message, this will have been set by KBUS.
	 *
	 *   When a user replies to a message, they should copy this value
	 *   into the 'in_reply_to' field, so that the recipient will know
	 *   what message this was a reply to.
	 *
	 * - 'in_reply_to' identifies the message this is a reply to.
	 *
	 *   This shall be set to {0,0} unless this message *is* a reply to a
	 *   previous message. In other words, if this value is non-0, then
	 *   the message *is* a reply.
	 *
	 * - 'to' is who the message is to be sent to.
	 *
	 *   When a user writes a new message, this should normally be set
	 *   to {0,0}, meaning "anyone listening" (but see below if "state"
	 *   is being maintained).
	 *
	 *   When replying to a message, it shall be set to the 'from' value
	 *   of the orginal message.
	 *
	 *   When constructing a request message (a message wanting a reply),
	 *   the user can set it to a specific replier id, to produce a stateful
	 *   request. This is normally done by copying the 'from' of a previous
	 *   Reply from the appropriate replier. When such a message is sent,
	 *   if the replier bound (at that time) does not have that specific
	 *   id, then the send will fail.
	 *
	 *   Note that if 'to' is set, then 'orig_from' should also be set.
	 *
	 * - 'from' indicates who sent the message.
	 *
	 *   When a user is writing a new message, they should set this
	 *   to {0,0}.
	 *
	 *   When a user is reading a message, this will have been set
	 *   by KBUS.
	 *
	 *   When a user replies to a message, the reply should have its
	 *   'to' set to the original messages 'from', and its 'from' set
	 *   to {0,0} (see the "hmm" caveat under 'to' above, though).
	 *
	 * - 'orig_from' and 'final_to' are used when Limpets are mediating
	 *   KBUS messages between KBUS devices (possibly on different
	 *   machines). See the description by the datastructure definition
	 *   above. The KBUS kernel preserves and propagates their values,
	 *   but does not alter or use them.
	 *
	 * - 'extra' is currently unused, and KBUS will set it to zero.
	 *   Future versions of KBUS may treat it differently.
	 *
	 * - 'flags' indicates the type of message.
	 *
	 *   When a user writes a message, this can be used to indicate
	 *   that:
	 *
	 *   * the message is URGENT
	 *   * a reply is wanted
	 *
	 *   When a user reads a message, this indicates if:
	 *
	 *   * the message is URGENT
	 *   * a reply is wanted
	 *
	 *   When a user writes a reply, this field should be set to 0.
	 *
	 *   The top half of the 'flags' is not touched by KBUS, and may
	 *   be used for any purpose the user wishes.
	 *
	 * - 'name_len' is the length of the message name in bytes.
	 *
	 *   This must be non-zero.
	 *
	 * - 'data_len' is the length of the message data in bytes. It may be
	 *   zero if there is no data.
	 *
	 * - 'name' is a pointer to the message name. This should be null
	 *   terminated, as is the normal case for C strings.
	 *
	 *   NB: If this is zero, then the name will be present, but after
	 *   the end of this datastructure, and padded out to a multiple of
	 *   four bytes (see kbus_entire_message). When doing this padding,
	 *   remember to allow for the terminating null byte. If this field is
	 *   zero, then 'data' shall also be zero.
	 *
	 * - 'data' is a pointer to the data. If there is no data (if
	 *   'data_len' is zero), then this shall also be zero. The data is
	 *   not touched by KBUS, and may include any values.
	 *
	 *   NB: If this is zero, then the data will occur immediately
	 *   after the message name, padded out to a multiple of four bytes.
	 *   See the note for 'name' above.

/*
 * Things KBUS changes in a message
 * --------------------------------
 * In general, KBUS leaves the content of a message alone. However, it does
 * change:
 *
 * - the message id (if id.network_id is unset - it assigns a new serial
 *   number unique to this message)
 * - the from id (if from.network_id is unset - it sets the local_id to
 *   indicate the Ksock this message was sent from)
 * - the KBUS_BIT_WANT_YOU_TO_REPLY bit in the flags (set or cleared
 *   as appropriate)
 * - the SYNTHETIC bit, which KBUS will always unset in a user message
 */

/*
 * Flags for the message 'flags' word
 * ----------------------------------
 * The KBUS_BIT_WANT_A_REPLY bit is set by the sender to indicate that a
 * reply is wanted. This makes the message into a request.
 *
 *     Note that setting the WANT_A_REPLY bit (i.e., a request) and
 *     setting 'in_reply_to' (i.e., a reply) is bound to lead to
 *     confusion, and the results are undefined (i.e., don't do it).
 *
 * The KBUS_BIT_WANT_YOU_TO_REPLY bit is set by KBUS on a particular message
 * to indicate that the particular recipient is responsible for replying
 * to (this instance of the) message. Otherwise, KBUS clears it.
 *
 * The KBUS_BIT_SYNTHETIC bit is set by KBUS when it generates a synthetic
 * message (an exception, if you will), for instance when a replier has
 * gone away and therefore a reply will never be generated for a request
 * that has already been queued.
 *
 *     Note that KBUS does not check that a sender has not set this
 *     on a message, but doing so may lead to confusion.
 *
 * The KBUS_BIT_URGENT bit is set by the sender if this message is to be
 * treated as urgent - i.e., it should be added to the *front* of the
 * recipient's message queue, not the back.
 *
 * Send flags
 * ==========
 * There are two "send" flags, KBUS_BIT_ALL_OR_WAIT and KBUS_BIT_ALL_OR_FAIL.
 * Either one may be set, or both may be unset.
 *
 *    If both bits are set, the message will be rejected as invalid.
 *
 *    Both flags are ignored in reply messages (i.e., messages with the
 *    'in_reply_to' field set).
 *
 * If both are unset, then a send will behave in the default manner. That is,
 * the message will be added to a listener's queue if there is room but
 * otherwise the listener will (silently) not receive the message.
 *
 *     (Obviously, if the listener is a replier, and the message is a request,
 *     then a KBUS message will be synthesised in the normal manner when a
 *     request is lost.)
 *
 * If the KBUS_BIT_ALL_OR_WAIT bit is set, then a send should block until
 * all recipients can be sent the message. Specifically, before the message is
 * sent, all recipients must have room on their message queues for this
 * message, and if they do not, the send will block until there is room for the
 * message on all the queues.
 *
 * If the KBUS_BIT_ALL_OR_FAIL bit is set, then a send should fail if all
 * recipients cannot be sent the message. Specifically, before the message is
 * sent, all recipients must have room on their message queues for this
 * message, and if they do not, the send will fail.

 *
 * This indicates whether it is a bind or unbind event, who is doing the
 * bind or unbind, and for what message name. The message name is padded
 * out to a multiple of four bytes, allowing for a terminating null byte,
 * but the name length is the length without said padding (so, in C terms,
 * strlen(name)).

 * As for the message header data structure, the actual data "goes off the end"

 * Standard message names
 * ======================
 * KBUS itself has some predefined message names.
 *
 * Synthetic Replies with no data
 * ------------------------------
 * These are sent to the original Sender of a Request when KBUS knows that the
 * Replier is not going to Reply. In all cases, you can identify which message
 * they concern by looking at the "in_reply_to" field:
 *
 * * Replier.GoneAway - the Replier has gone away before reading the Request.
 * * Replier.Ignored - the Replier has gone away after reading a Request, but
 *   before replying to it.
 * * Replier.Unbound - the Replier has unbound (as Replier) from the message
 *   name, and is thus not going to reply to this Request in its unread message
 *   queue.
 * * Replier.Disappeared - the Replier has disappeared when an attempt is made
 *   to send a Request whilst polling (i.e., after EAGAIN was returned from an
 *   earlier attempt to send a message). This typically means that the Ksock
 *   bound as Replier closed.
 * * ErrorSending - an unexpected error occurred when trying to send a Request
 *   to its Replier whilst polling.
 *
 * Synthetic Announcements with no data
 * ------------------------------------
 * * UnbindEventsLost - sent (instead of a Replier Bind Event) when the unbind
 *   events "set aside" list has filled up, and thus unbind events have been
 *   lost.
